# Installation & How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/milquipomoytheamazing/CS2.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```
   cd BudgetBuddy
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```
   python BudgetBuddy.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. The program loads stored financial data from a JSON file.

2. Users choose options from a menu (add income, add expense, etc.).

3. The program updates transactions and automatically recalculates totals.

4. Savings progress is computed as:

   ```
   Savings = Total Income − Total Expenses
   Progress (%) = (Savings ÷ Savings Goal) × 100
   ```

5. Data is saved automatically after every update.

## Key Design Decisions

* JSON was used instead of a database to keep the system simple and beginner-friendly.
* A command-line interface (CLI) was chosen to focus on logic and functionality.
* Data is stored locally to maintain user privacy.

## Programming and Computing Ethics

This project follows principles from the **Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics**:

* Respecting intellectual property by writing original code
* Protecting user privacy by storing data locally
* Ensuring transparency in financial calculations
* Designing a simple and accessible user interface
