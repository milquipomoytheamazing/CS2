4. Methodology
How Core Features Were Implemented
Data Storage

Transactions are stored in a JSON file as dictionaries:

transaction = {"type": type, "amount": amount, "category": category, "date": date}


Data loads when the program starts and saves automatically after updates.

Financial Calculations

Totals are calculated using Python’s built-in functions.

Savings Formula:

Savings = Total Income − Total Expenses

Savings Progress (%) = (Savings ÷ Savings Goal) × 100

5. Technologies Used (with Justification)
Technology	Reason
Python	Simple and beginner-friendly
JSON	Lightweight local data storage
datetime	Tracks transaction dates
Git & GitHub	Version control and collaboration

6. Key Design Decisions & Trade-offs
Decision	Reason
Console-based interface	Focus on functionality
Local JSON storage	No database required
Single-file structure	Easier for beginner-level project

Trade-off:
No graphical interface (future improvement).
